A small (2k unminified) javascript library that exists to add left/right swipe support for touch devices on any website.

Still very much a work in progress, no warranties expressed or implied, may cause your website to break, your server to explode, or the heat death of the universe. 

Note: this has only been tested in iOS so far. Android WebKit, Opera mini, etc. testing to come as I can find emulators and devices to test on.

Excelsior!
